Tap and keydown adventure!

This is part of an art installation for artist Edwin Bolta, called "Fool: Out of Nothing". Credits to him for graphics and sounds, and credits to jonobr1 for inspiring both of us. I built Fool as a noob version of Patatap using SVGs, CSS animations, audio sprites, and jQuery/javascript.
