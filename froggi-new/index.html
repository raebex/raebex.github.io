              <p>If you've ever knitted before, I'm pretty sure you've run into the problem of starting over a project because you cast on two extra stitches, or something similarly frustrating.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>No more gauging!</h3>
              <p>The existing gauge system is rather confusing, especially to beginners. Froggi makes sure knitters no longer have to fiddle and waste time with crazy calculations.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Time &amp; sanity saved</h3>
              <p>Start your project right away and forget about tedious swatching and gauge calucations. Froggi takes away the fear of frogging. </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Easy inputs</h3>
              <p>With Froggi's easy input form, choose variables based on your project, such as yarn weight, needle size, and type of stitch.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Instant calculations</h3>
              <p>Press the 'calculate!' button and instantly find out the exact number of stitches you need to cast on.</p>
