            Foodie is built with Ruby on Rails and Vue.js and allows users to order food from each other, private
            kitchens, and established businesses without storefronts. Chefs are able to post dishes with prices,
            pictures, and a description, organize dishes into menu categories, set opening hours and days, and text
            patrons delivery information, automated via the Twilio app. Patrons can search for dishes by cuisine and
            dietary restrictions, add dishes to a shopping cart, choose between delivery or takeout, and check out with
            their credit card. Payment processing is handled with the Stripe API. It functions as an e-commerce site,
            but is powered by the community. Check out the

            Foodie is heavily inspired by universally loved, local Chicago celebrity
            <a href="https://www.tamaleguychicago.com/" target="_blank">Tamale Guy</a>
            . Before COVID, he frequented Chicago bars after kitchens closed with a red cooler full of tamales and was a
            savior for drunk, hungry people. After lockdown, he started taking orders via phone before getting the
            opportunity to open his own restaurant.
