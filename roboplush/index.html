      <p>Roboplush is made with servo motors powering its arms and a 5X2 LED matrix for its mouth. Sensors include an accelerometer for shake/upside down motions, a large force-sensitive resistor for the tummy tickle, and a smaller FSR for the head pat. A vibration motor is also included and fires during the "sad" state. A video is coming soon, I promise!</p>

      <p>Roboplush was also featured in the 2014 <a class="link" href="http://www.chitagfair.com/">Chicago Toy and Game Fair</a> with Columbia College Chicago. This was a great opportunity to do market research with some adorable, pint-sized clients! </p>

    <h3 class="project-header">The Future of Roboplush</h3>
    <div class="project-description subsection"> 
      <p>These functionalities involving direct human interaction make up the first stage of Roboplush, and the second evolution would involve communication between paired Roboplushes. Each plushie will have an Xbee chip inside. The chips will allow bytes to be sent back and forth when a “tickle” or a “shake” happens. When paired with another, Roboplush can have more complex feelings of jealousy and anger.
      <br><br>
      The final form of Roboplush will be paired with an app. This is the future goal and the point where manufacturing will be considered. The plushies will still work as a pair. For example,  User A and User B must both have the Roboplush app installed on a mobile device. User A writes a message within the app and tags it as positive, negative, or neutral and sends it to User B. User B's plushie serves as a “new message” notifier and reacts accordingly: happy when a positive message is sent, sad with a negative one, and straight-faced with a neutral one (in this case, the neutral state will have to be enhanced with arm flaps or vibration to serve as an alert). The actual message can be read with User B's Roboplush app.
      <br><br>
      The capabilities of the Roboplush app do not end at communication. It will also include a battery charge indicator and a simple game to alter Roboplush's mood: the user feeds a GUI Roboplush rogue electrons. Once it's full, at 50 electrons, both GUI and plushie Roboplush will go into the “happy” state. If the user hasn't fed Roboplush in a while, and the plushie is still on, plushie Roboplush will go into the “sad” state every few hours just to remind the user that it is hungry.
      <br><br>
      Messaging has been evolving away from text for a while now, and even simple ascii emojis are being phased out. Almost every chat service nowadays, such as Skype, Twitch, Facebook, has their own set of smiley faces. Facebook and WeChat have also started incorporating sets of reaction gifs into their products. Snapchat allows users to use their own selfies as emojis. A facial reference is an instant way of expressing a feeling, something that language can't accomplish as quickly. Roboplush takes emoticons to the physical realm. Even without the Roboplush app, having LED emoticons on a real toy bridges the gap between the online and the physical world. The future of plush toys will definitely involve an online presence, and not just with purchase codes!
      <br><br>
      Roboplush knows that a smile means happy, a frown means sad, and a rival tickle means it will be jealous. However, these preprogrammed states of emotion are an extremely limited cross-section of all possible emotions. Perhaps artificial intelligence will be in Roboplush's future?</p>
