                      <h3>Who we are</h3>
                      <p>The Presence of Yes Campaign was founded by Columbia College Chicago students. This website, and all of its affiliates (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), are currently maintained by students in Women and Gender Studies courses at CCC.</p>
                      <br><br>
                      <h3>What we are</h3>
                      <p>The Presence of Yes Campaign is an initiative to address the current issue of sexual assault on college campuses. We aim to stop the under reporting and overlooking of sexual assault cases. Our name comes from the idea that the absence of no is not grounds to have sex with someone, it's the presence of yes. We also want to fix the lack of care shown by school administrators and faculty and remind them that rape is not an "academic grievance", it's a crime. Every victim of sexual assault can choose whether s/he wants to report the attack, but we must make sure that when they want to, they are able to do so. Rape is a crime punishable by prison, not by a slap on the wrist.</p>
                      <br><br>
                      <h3>What we support</h3>
                      <p class="selected">Enthusiastic Consent</p>
                      <p>
                      Participation in sexual activities require enthusiastic consent. The idea is that as a partner in sexual activities it is your responsibility to gain not only consent but enthusiastic consent. Enthusiastic consent refers to consent that is not given under conditions where a partner may feel that they are unable to say no, fear to say no or coerced into saying yes. If your partner or you do not say yes in a safe, pressure free environment, then there is no consent. Bottom line, “Yes” does not always mean “Yes,” it may mean “No.”</p>
                      <br><br>
                      <p class="selected">The Acknowledgement of Our Harmful Rape Culture</p>
                      <p>
                      Rape culture is a culture in which sexual assault is desensitized. Through social media, ‘comedic’ jokes, TV, films, sexual shaming, behavioral gender expectations, advertising, music and other public imagery sexual assault is made to seem normal and unavoidable. By making rape and sexual assault seem like a part of life it is naturalized and accepted by society. Because of this when an individual tries to report an assault, our culture becomes angry and looks for reasons why the victim is to blame; i.e. clothes, time of day, alcohol and drug use, etc. This type of culture of is a culture in which women feel unsafe to walk alone at night, leave their drinks unattended and so on because this culture strengthens the belief that women are not protected or safe even though rape is not inclusive to women but all people.</p>
