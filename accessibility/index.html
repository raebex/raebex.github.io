    <div class="project-description">
      <p>During my time at <a href="https://braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>, I focused a lot on accessibility. I made it my mission to have all public facing websites compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG AA guidelines</a>. We didn't quite make it to 100% percent, but perfection is never the main goal. Rather, I wanted to foster a culture where we considered "web for all" as part of the design and development process, not an afterthought. The following slides are from a presentation at an internal conference where I spoke about the importance of accessibility, and the journey my team took towards a more accessible digital environment.</p>
